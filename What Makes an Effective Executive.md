So what do [[Effective]] [[Leader]]s have in common? They get the right things done, in the right ways - by following eight simple rules:
1. Ask what needs to be done.
2. Ask what's right for the enterprise.
3. Develop [[Action Plan]]s.
4. Take [[Responsibility]] for [[Decision]]s.
5. Take responsibility for communicating ([[Communication]]).
6. [[Focus]] on [[Opportunities]], not [[Problem]]s.
7. Run productive meetings.
8. Think and say "We", not "I".

**Take responsibility for communicating**
Get input from superiors, subordinates, and peers on your [[Action Plan]]s. Let each know what [[Information]] you need to get the job done. Pay equal attention to peers' and superiors' information needs.

**Focus on opportunities, not problems.**
You get results by [[Exploiting]] [[Opportunities]], not [[Solving Problems]]. Identify changes inside and outside your organisation (new technologies, product innovations, new market structures), asking "How can we exploit this change to benefit our enterprise?" Then match your best people with the best opportunities.

The answer to the question "What needs to be done?" almost always contains more than one urgent task. But effective executives do not splinter themselves. They concentrate on one task if at all possible. If they are among those people - a sizeable minority - who work best with a change of pace in their working day, they pick two tasks.

Then he concentrated on that task; the others he delegated. Effective executives try to focus on jobs they'll do especially well. They know that enterprises perform if top management performs - and don't if it doesn't.

Asking "What is right for the enterprise?" does not guarantee that the right decision will be made. Even the most brilliant executive is human and thus prone to mistake and prejudices. But failure to ask the question virtually guarantees the wrong decision.

Take responsibility for decisions. A decision has not been made until people know:
- the name of the person accountable for carrying it out;
- the deadline;
- the names of the people who will be affected by the decision and therefore have to know about, understand, and approve it - or at least not be strongly opposed to it;
- the names of the people who have to be informed of the decision, even if they are not directly affected by it;

It is just as important to review decisions periodically - at a time that's been agreed on in advance - as it is to make them carefully in the first place. That way, a poor decision can be corrected before it does real damage. These reviews can cover anything from the results to the assumptions underlying the decision.

Organisations are held together by [[Information]] rather than by [[Ownership]] or [[Command]]. Still, far too many executives behave as if information and its flow were the job of the information specialist - for example, the accountant. As a result, they get an enormous amount of data they do not need and cannot use, but little of the information they do need. The best way around this problem is for each executive to identify the information he needs, ask for it, and keep pushing until gets it.

But problem solving, however necessary, does not produce results. It prevents damage. Exploiting opportunities produces results.

Effective executives put their best people on opportunities rather than on problems.
