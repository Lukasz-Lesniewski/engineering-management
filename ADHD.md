There is some evidence suggesting a relationship between anxiety, [[ADHD]] (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), and difficulties with focus or concentration. It's important to note that while there may be correlations, each of these conditions is distinct and has its own set of diagnostic criteria.

1. **Anxiety and ADHD:**
   - [[Anxiety]] disorders and ADHD often coexist. Individuals with ADHD may experience higher levels of anxiety, possibly due to the challenges they face in managing [[Attention]], [[Impulsivity]], and [[Hyperactivity]]. Conversely, anxiety can also contribute to difficulties with [[Focus]] and attention.

2. **Inability to Focus:**
   - Both anxiety and ADHD can contribute to difficulties with [[Concentration]]. In anxiety, excessive worry and fear can occupy one's thoughts, making it challenging to focus on tasks. ADHD, on the other hand, is characterised by persistent patterns of [[Inattention]], [[Impulsivity]], and [[Hyperactivity]], which can interfere with sustained [[Focus]].

3. **[[Jumping Thoughts]]:**
   - [[Racing thoughts]] or a mind that jumps rapidly from one idea to another can be associated with both anxiety and ADHD. In anxiety, this may be a result of [[Overthinking]] and [[Excessive Worry]]. In ADHD, it may be related to the [[Impulsivity]] and [[Distractibility]] that are characteristic of the disorder.

It's essential to recognise that these conditions can occur independently, and not everyone with ADHD experiences [[Anxiety]] or vice versa. Additionally, other factors such as [[Stress]], [[Depression]], or other mental health conditions can also contribute to difficulties with [[Focus]] and [[Concentration]].

For self-help, the following things could help:
* [[Journaling]] - Write down your thoughts and feelings - it can be a therapeutic way to process emotions and gain [[Clarity]].
* [[Break Tasks]] into [[Smaller Steps]] - similar to [[Power of Small Wins]], if you have a task that feels overwhelming, break it into smaller, more manageable steps. This can make it easier to [[Focus]] and accomplish.
* Having a [[Clean Desk]] - it can allow to reduce [[Distractibility]]
* Having organised things can help with managing them both in terms of [[Time Management]] and reduction of [[Distractibility]] when you're doing some task
* Having a list of tasks to be done in specific order - preferably starting from those that are giving more pleasure to build up [[Momentum]], as having ADHD makes things hard to start. The first tasks shouldn't be the biggest (swallowing the frog) or most important - but giving a boost of [[Motivation]] while already doing them.
* Having space for cover their [[Hyperactivity]] with [[Strength Resistance Training]], [[Martial Arts]] or [[Hiking]]
* Having a clear, short [[Deadline]] - despite that this is a management via [[Stress]], it can help starting the task.

### [[Motivation]]
Non-ADD people are mainly motivated by 3 factors that have external source - [[Reward]], [[Consequences]] or [[Deadlines]].

ADD people are mainly motivated by 5 factors that have internal source:
1. [[Interest]]
2. [[Competition]] or [[Challenge]]
3. Sense of [[Urgency]]
4. [[Novelty]] and [[Creativity]]
5. [[Passion]]

As those are internal and it is not always easy to become interested/passionate on things that are not for the ADD person, it could by better idea to go with the Charles Bukowsky "Don't Try" motto. So instead of trying to motivate oneself with pure, depletable [[Willpower]] it would be better to create an environment where ADD person doesn't have to try - and can explode with their inner passion instead.

### Huberman Notes

* Low-dopamin hypothesis of ADHD - if dopamin levels are too low, it leads to unnecessary firing of neurons in the brain that are unrelated to the task being done and that is unrelated to the information to be tried to focus on. 
* ADHD person more often tries to use recreational drugs or non-drug stimulants (6 cups of coffee, smoking half a pack of cigarets)
* ADHD children have preference of sugar, as it also acts as a stimulant.
* Those stimulants are allowing to get HyperFocus for ADHD person and becoming calm. People without ADHD becomes hyperactive and behaving wild.
* Ritalin was 1st generation, nowadays Adderall is typically prescribed for ADHD. The first one was auto-realeasing for longer period of time, having a chance to hit bad deeps and ups of natural cycle of activity, making it more random in effect of helping or making things more worse. The latter one has to be taken when needed and has short time of working, allowing to tailor it by the user for proper time of exposition.
* Elimination diet helps for ADHD with eliminating:
	* food that is allergic to (it is controversial, as not exposing for some food can make you allergic to it)
	* simple sugars (honey, sugar, chocolate, low carbs)
	* Omega-3 fats that have anti-depressant, mood elevation effects, helping in cardiovascular and immune system - and also on focus and attention. This is happening od 1000mg of EPA. This is only a modulatory role though.
* Attention blinks - ADHD people are having much more of them then normal people. This leads to the theory that ADHD could be not failing to focus (this is the outcome), but over-focusing on certain things and there by missing other things - a distractibility exists because they're over-focusing on certain elements and missing other elements they should be attending to.
* Open monitoring - switch to the panoramic view, seeing more and not focusing on the single point by dilating eye gaze can help to reduce number of attention blinks. So going to nature with mountains like in Norway could help in doing that panoramic view naturally, which could reduce number of attention blinks.
* Blinking controls time perception. The rate of blinking is controlled by the dopamine. This means that dopamine controlling attention, blinks relates to attention and focus, thus dopamine and blinking is one system that controls and modulates the perception of time. When dopamine goes up people tend to overestimate on how long something lasted. When dopamine are lower people tend to underestimate time intervals. ADHD people have issue with organising the time, or rather "in time" due to naturally low dopamine levels and underestimate time and losing track of time.
* How often you blink is a brain decision on how much information is going to nervous system and what size.
* ADHD drugs with Caffeine will have cardiovascular effects of having elevated heart rate, constricted veins. ADHD drugs can have also sex side effects of increased stimuli but decreased performance.
* There are technologies that are making it harder to focus regarding of having or not ADHD. Smartphone with fast context-switching is a problem with small perspective and lots of visual motion and things that are happening. This can induce similar to ADHD or ADHD and inattention in users. Smartphones shouldn't be used for longer than 15 minutes per day to limit their negative effect.

### Positive sides of ADHD to be explored
* Ability for **hyperfocus** for long periods of time similar to the **flow** state, but without getting exhausted and distracted from hours to days.
* Creating **unique** and **creative** **perspectives** of virtually anything around them that allows tackling problems on which others had stuck and producing solutions others haven't seen.
* Generating lots of ideas on the topic in short time frame if allowed to do that outside brainstorming meetings.
* Generally being calm under pressure.

### Negative sides of ADHD to be managed outside of the employee by the manager itself
* Importance or delayed rewards are bad motivators or de-motivators.
* Performing mundane tasks can lead to careless mistakes or overlooking details.
* Failing following instructions to the letter.
* Issues with self-organisation and organisation.
* Missing deadlines due to the broken time-perception that has to be externalised to physical tools.
* Self auto-inducing more anxiety and stress over neurotypical people by being more driven emotionally by subconscious mind.
* Tendency to leave unfinished projects.
* Hyperactivity that can lead to pacing, requiring setting up regular tempo by doing more physical exercises - especially more aerobic ones like even walking.
* Insomnia.

### How to help ADHD engineers to manage their productivity

#### Task intensity meter
For neurotypical people task has some intensity meter to be done - and it is quite similar for them. Taking out the trash can be a low intensity. Cleaning the desk can be a medium intensity. Cleaning the whole house can be a high intensity.

For the ADHD people, intensity of such task can be totally different, due to their emotional attachment and reactions. Thus it is a good idea to help figuring out engineers what is the intensity of their daily tasks to understand better what they're capable of doing. Some of the things they will make thus slower then others, but also other they will do much faster and better. What is a high intensity for neurotypical person can be a low intensity task for ADHD person that can be done continuously whole day.
