- [[Knowledge Workers]] have two distinct kinds of trust that is essential to work effectively:
	- [[Competence Trust]] - belief others will deliver high quality work
	- [[Interpersonal Trust]] - belief others have good intentions and high integrity
	  To trust in those ways we need to see signals of action, motivation and reliability.
* [[Work From Home]] makes harder to spot those signals
* Lack of psychical contact is unconsciously interpreted as untrustworthiness.
* In [[Virtual Work]] [[Misunderstandings]] and [[Miscommunication]] abound.
* Instead of developing trust in others, it is better to develop trust coming from oneself, as the trust is reciprocal - so others can trust if they're trusted first become they will become trustworthy.
* It is important to also communicate things that don't change - so it is known on what people can count on - which gives predictability.
* There are two types of trusters:
	* [[Automatic Trusters]] - their default state is to trust.
	* [[Evidence-Based Trusters]] - their default state is to distrust.
	The former are easier to build trust in the [[Virtual Environment]] then the latter.

* The [[psychological safety]] is the belief that one can speak up without the risk of [[punishment]] or [[humiliation]]. It helps with high-quality [[Decision]] making, greater [[innovation]] and effective [[execution]].
* Because [[Work From Home]] blurs [[work-life balance]], candor and respect are not enough. Accounting of employee's scheduling is also needed to taken with more flexibility options.

* The challenge is not only to start strong but stay strong - creating staying power.
* Setting low and high boundaries, so you can do what is needed but not overbearing yourself.
* Trying to note the tendencies near low and high bounds to observe what and why is is happening.
