- [[Knowledge Workers]] have two distinct kinds of trust that is essential to work effectively:
	- [[Competence Trust]] - belief others will deliver high quality work
	- [[Interpersonal Trust]] - belief others have good intentions and high integrity
	  To trust in those ways we need to see signals of action, motivation and reliability.
* [[Work From Home]] makes harder to spot those signals
* Lack of psychical contact is unconsciously interpreted as untrustworthiness.
* In [[Virtual Work]] [[Misunderstandings]] and [[Miscommunication]] abound.
* Instead of developing trust in others, it is better to develop trust coming from oneself, as the trust is reciprocal - so others can trust if they're trusted first become they will become trustworthy.
* It is important to also communicate things that don't change - so it is known on what people can count on - which gives predictability.
* There are two types of trusters:
	* [[Automatic Trusters]] - their default state is to trust.
	* [[Evidence-Based Trusters]] - their default state is to distrust.
	The former are easier to build trust in the [[Virtual Environment]] then the latter.
