* There is a person we want to become and the person we are currently. We believe that it will take us lots of work to become who we want to be. But this person is already inside us - so it is about unlearning all that isn't us - so we can emerge finally.
* The building of the skill is interesting - but we don't want honestly the skills but how we want to feel - confident, safe, alive, be myself. From that place developing a skills is creativity (I'm good enough) not stress (I'm not good).
* Ego is just inability to understand cause and effect outside of you.
* We create beliefs that we are responsible for the world and carry them with us from childhood cause we thought that everything was related to us - and if it was bad it was due to us not being good enough.
* It is not the part of the brain related to logic and reason that is making the decisions by emotional brain - based on my belief system that drives my behaviour.
* Discipline is internal conflict between pre-frontal cortex and amigdula.
* We are born and everything is on the table. Everything is an option - infinite possibility. During our childhood we start taking things out of the table by saying:
	* I don't have that so I don't deserve it.
	* My family doesn't have that so it is not being possible.
	* This will be hard and not easy.
* Dreams are just the things that you come up with as possibilities. "Realistic Dream" is just what is on the table that have left - not what really is possible but just our beliers.
* There is a table somewhere out that belongs to you with infinite possibilities.
* The first step is to get clear what I took of the table - being social? being fun? leading? Looking for "but" appearing on descriptions as list. Becoming curious what was the reason of taking it out of the table. Is it a fact or just assumption?
* Close your eyes and imagine an ideal. If everything was possible. And immediately what is my first block?
* Take one relationship with thing or people and imagine what my ideal relationship to that would be?
* When I have a list of blocks I want to start exploring alternative way of thinking by de-personalising it (not to be blocked on how I feel). Thinking objectively for another person having this block - and advising him.
* Pre-frontal cortex goes of when you are emotionally triggered - this is normal and requires enormous amount of willpower to stop and cope with it.
* Personal Development Industry gets it wrong when it says that it has to be hard, painful, you have to be different then you are.
* It should be fun, creative exploration of infinite possibilities for Personal Development.
* It is not about being better (this doesn't exist), it is about reclaiming yourself, to enjoy being oneself.
* If you want to change your beliefs, you will make it fun and playful - celebrating that you discovered tem.
* If you feel worthy of something you take it into the table. If you feel unworthy of something you take it out of the table.
* There is so much things that depletes your energy because of your relationship to this thing (not the thing itself taking out your energy).
* As you age you start to limit your possibilities due to things that had happened to you. You become cynical, angry, limited, afraid.
* If you would have a belief that failing is a part of life - the failures wouldn't impact you. If you have a belief that if you will make the mistake it will be the end of the world - it will stress yourself out not to make them.
* The beliefs you have determine what is hard for you, not objective facts. It determines how you interpret things and what you create.
* You cannot teach you kids that your way is the right way. You need to take their ways into account and explain that your way of doing things is one of many valid ways of doing it.
* Your kids cannot end feeling powerless because what they want doesn't matter because some thing have to happen.
* Powerlessness is often the one that triggers the anger - way of coping with powerlessness as anger is giving us power.
* Distinguishing between "my way" and "your way" can prevent your child from feeling powerlessness - and being clear that "my way" is not the "right way" - just a way you do not the family does.
* When you will believe that there is a right way and wrong way you will go over your whole life looking for the right way - which will cause a lot of anxiety (as fear of doing it wrong).
* Leave the children a space for ding things in their way - communicating it is valid and important (their way).
* "Your way" is playing now on the carpet, "Daddy way" is going now to kindergarten and we will do now the "Daddy way".
* Coming from the place of curiosity about your child's emotions - helping them to understand how they're feeling. Learning how to listen to themselves and understand.
* As an adult you don't know why you are emotional - so you cannot be mad on your child that it behaves emotionally without controlling it.
* If you are not doing something that you want to or said you will do it - it is not because you lack of discipline, you are lazy or it is something wrong with you - it is related if this is aligned with your belief - like working hard or achieving something - this is what makes you safe by your brain
* Your brain is not designed to keep you happy but to keep you safe. The sense of safety develops during your first seven years. This is the thing that creates harmony in your family. If the conflict was creating disharmony, you will fear the conflict.
* The things that are blocking you with resistance feeling are those that were creating disharmony in your family.
* If being well-liked, smart or achieving was creating harmony - you link that to safety.
* Things that created sense of safety runs your life.
* Label the things that makes you fear or uncomfortable. Being unsafe doesn't allow to solve problems - being uncomfortable allows discomfort, nervous or uncomfortable suggests it can be solved from safety angle.
* Meditation daily on the feeling you want to have can help build safety on it. You can start with memory of it to anchor to it.
* Starting asking yourself what are the things or environments that are triggering this feeling and starting surrounding yourself with them.
* You need to do both - external and internal so they can have positive feedback loop on themselves. You shouldn't be afraid of being dependent on external motivation.
* Being not dependent on others comes from powerless feeling - and trying to fight it.
* Emotions is something we have and they run behaviour, doesn't matter if you express them. It is not about feeling feelings or not. It is about the drives for behaviour.
* You brain uses 5% of it power for willpower, increasing it even to 7% won't make it a big impact - removing your blocks will.
* We give to others what we need for ourselves. We are practicing for our most important clients - us.
* You shouldn't have to learn how to love yourself. It is hard and stressful - when in reality we already love ourselves. Instead we have to understand that we are already loving ourselves unconditionally. The issue is that we have seen unhealthy way of expressing this love. We love ourselves and want to be safe - i.e. being lazy, or screaming. We have to change the expression of love and its understanding.
* Information doesn't change behaviour - insight does. You have to personalise it to get it into emotional brain.
* Anxiety is related to fear. If you can look at it that your brain is telling you that you're unsafe. You can re-frame it as uncomfortable. "If I fail I'll die" - this is what your brain tells you if you're feeling unsafe.
* Anxiety very often is not an emotion but resistance to the emotion.
* Shoving the motions down to suppress them can create anxiety. Instead you should learn how to express those emotions.
* The first step is figuring out what you want. The second step is figuring out what are the block you have that are stopping you for creating.
* Willpower should be the last resort.
* Behaviour or mindset change is not hard. It is hard only if you don't know what you're doing - and going into wrong direction by taking wrong path.
