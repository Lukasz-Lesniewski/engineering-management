For the [[Energy]] and [[Motivation]], the following strategies could be used:
* [[Progress Principle]] - Making a progress on work that you find meaningful can drive you in your work and make you feel good about it.
* [[Power of Small Wins]] - can start and keep your [[Progress Principle]]
* Negative events are stronger then positive events on [[Energy]] and [[Motivation]]. Thus first we should remove the [[Restraining Forces]] instead of trying to increase Motivation by increasing the [[Driving Forces]].
* It is a good idea to have daily 30-60 minutes of non-distracted, non-interrupted time to have focus to do meaningful work for us and important to the organisation. Preferably in the morning.
* Keeping track on those small wins.

* If you are not utterly yourself at the time you are at your work, you are doing "emotional labor" - an extra effort to keep up to the professional game face that is not concordant with how you feel.
* When people habitually evoke the stress of surface acting, they'll be more prone to depression and anxiety, decreased job performance and burnout.
* When you feel that all work you are doing is something you have to do, and not want to do, it is  easy to fall into "Time to make the donuts" mentality of working without caring about it.
