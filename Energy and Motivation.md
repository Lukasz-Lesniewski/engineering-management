For the [[Energy]] and [[Motivation]], the following strategies could be used:
* [[Progress Principle]] - Making a progress on work that you find meaningful can drive you in your work and make you feel good about it.
* [[Power of Small Wins]] - can start and keep your [[Progress Principle]]
* Negative events are stronger then positive events on [[Energy]] and [[Motivation]]. Thus first we should remove the [[Restraining Forces]] instead of trying to increase Motivation by [[Driving Forces]].
* It is a good idea to have daily 30-60 minutes of non-distracted, non-interrupted time to have focus to do meaningful work for us and important to the organisation. Preferably in the morning.
* Keeping track on those small wins.
