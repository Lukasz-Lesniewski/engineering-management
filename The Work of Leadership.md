Leaders that truly care for their followers expose the to the painful reality of their condition and demand that they fashion a response. Instead of giving people false assurance that their best is good enough, leaders insist that people surpass themselves. And rather than smoothing over conflicts, leaders force disputes to the surface.

Leaders who cultivate emotional fortitude soon learn that they can achieve when they maximise their follower's well-being instead of their comfort.

Adaptive change is distressing for the people going through it. They need to take on new roles, new relationships, new values, new behaviours, and new approaches to work. Many employees are ambivalent about the efforts and sacrifices required of them. They often look to the senior executive to take problems off their shoulders. But those expectations have to be unlearned.

Rather than fulfilling the expectation that they will provide answers, leaders have to ask tough questions. Rather than protecting people from outside threats, leaders should allow them to feel the pinch of reality in order to stimulate them to adapt.

Instead of quelling conflict, leaders have to draw the issues out. Instead of maintaining norms, leaders have to challenge the way we do business and help others distinguish immutable values from historical practices that must go.

The work of the leader is to get conflict out into the open and use it as a source of creativity.
