1. Do not [[Learn]] if you do not [[Understand]]
2. [[Learn]] before [[Memorising]] - build an overall [[Big Picture]] of the learned knowledge
3. Build upon the [[Basics]] - [[Simple]] models are easier to [[Comprehend]], you can always build upon them later on
4. Stick to the [[Minimum Information]] principle - the material you [[Learn]] must be formulated in as [[Simple]] way as it is only possible, simplicity is imperative due to the way the brain works. We want minimum amount of information to be retrieved from memory in a single repetition - we want answer to be as short as imaginably possible. We can achieve that by:
	1. [[Simple]] is [[Easy]] - it makes for the brain to create easy to [[Replay]] [[Synaptic Connection]]s when [[Retrieving]] the information back
	2. [[Repetitions]] of [[Simple]] items are easier to [[Schedule]] - this will allow to get lots of small items that doesn't require lots of repetitions to remember, instead of having few big items that need to be constantly repeated
5. [[Cloze deletion]] is [[Easy]] and [[Effective]] - this is a sentence with its parts missing and replaced by three dots. This helps sticking to the [[Minimum Information]] principle.
6. Use [[Imagery]] - a graphic presentation of information requires less visual processing power
7. Avoid the sets of objects or collection of them to be repeated or memorise instead split them into singular items
8. Combat [[Interference]] - Remove from [[Anki]] all cards that are having similar meaning of sounding and can create confusion for the brain memory on where to place it.
