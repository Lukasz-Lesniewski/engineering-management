* Know what is required of you and what's allowed - regularly align with your team on priorities, rules, orders. With boss and direct reports.
* Decide what you want to be known for and specialise in it.
* Finish what you start - don't juggle too many balls and break work into manageable, small tasks.
* Focus your relationship building on the work - write great thank-you notes and channel discussion of problems into continuous improvement via after-action reviews.

* The [[expectation]]s and [[rules]] about how the [[interaction]]s are taking place should be made.
* Similarly, the clear lines of [[accountability]] should be established.
* This allows for upfront setting a monthly, quarterly and yearly performance goals.
* Visiting employees on regular basis in physical location is important to reduce natural detached feeling for people who are working remotely.
* For setting up the [[interaction]] rules, the expected time on the waiting for response for each channel should be made - so the whole team understands that they have an obligation to stay in the regular contact despite remote work.
* There are two types of remote work - synchronous one, when people are having similar working hours, and asynchronous one with longer expected time of waiting for the response.

* Work from Home is naturally less motivating as a total motivation to work. WFH has his own motivational benefits in comparison to on-site that are related mostly to individual perspective, but has degradatory motivational effect on social and cooperation perspective. Thus it has to be learned on how to be motivated while doing WFH to cover change in social relations and usage of new tools for new ways of cooperation.
* WFH can create feelings of isolation, which can be translated by the individual for emotional pressure and economic pressure that can demotivate. Those pressures will be self-created.
* Inertia for work can make people asking themselves if there is a point in trying.
* Form of play at work motivates and increases performance, but can decrease if it is harder to get things done when working from home in comparison with on-site. This could be a big problem in hybrid work that allows on-site communication.
* The purpose can motivate, but can decline if there is lack of team visibility into their impact on clients and colleagues.
* Potential can decline without access to colleagues who can teach and develop others.
* The most powerful way to make work engaging is to give people the opportunity to experiment and solve problems that really matters.
