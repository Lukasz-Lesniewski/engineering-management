* Know what is required of you and what's allowed - regularly align with your team on priorities, rules, orders. With boss and direct reports.
* Decide what you want to be known for and specialise in it.
* Finish what you start - don't juggle too many balls and break work into manageable, small tasks.
* Focus your relationship building on the work - write great thank-you notes and channel discussion of problems into continuous improvement via after-action reviews.
